      <h3>What is the Tree Selector Tool?</h3>
      <p>
        The Pennsylvania Tree Selector Tool is a comprehensive
        Pennsylvania-specific tool that provides landowners and conservation
        planners with an easy-to-use, effective means to select native species
        to plant on projects based on variables input by the user. Data and
        selections within the tool are designed to assist seasoned professionals
        as well as those who are new to the field by cutting research time and
        increasing efficiency. The selections within the tool provide
        site-specific solutions with a wide variety of options and data to back
        it up, ensuring that the correct species are planted in the correct
        locations. The tool generates a list of species based on inputs and
        includes attributes of each species such as soil preferences, growth
        rate, shade tolerance, and much more.
      </p>

        The Pennsylvania Tree Selector Tool is an easy-to-use tool for both
        professionals and landowners and provides data that is critical for
        decision-making in the field.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        As part of their commitment to Chesapeake Bay restoration goals,
        Pennsylvania has set a target of planting 95,000 acres of riparian
        forest buffer by the year 2025. As on-the-ground restoration partners
        like volunteer groups, watershed associations, nonprofits, and state
        agencies work to accelerate progress toward this goal, there is a need
        for resources to improve both the planting design process and to ensure
        survivorship of new tree plantings.
      </p>
      <p>
        While developing restoration and tree planting plans, groups such as
        Chesapeake Conservancy and Chesapeake Bay Foundation realized that there
        was no publicly-available, comprehensive Pennsylvania-specific web tool
        to choose native species for projects. It was realized that if such a
        tool was developed, it could improve planning efficiency and ensure the
        right species are planted in the right locations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first version of the tool was a simple Excel spreadsheet created by
        Chesapeake Bay Foundation field staff that could be sorted and filtered
        to select species with desired attributes. The sheet had robust amounts
        of information and worked well but it saw limited use. It was realized
        that if the sheet were more aesthetically appealing, easier to use, and
        produced better outputs it would likely be used by more people. So,
        Chesapeake Conservancy and Susquehanna University set about to migrate
        the spreadsheet to a much more user-friendly and aesthetically improved
        Google sheet. This improved sheet was much more appealing and had many
        more users than the original but had challenges in terms of usability
        and outputs. Thus the idea to create an app or website to solve these
        problems and take this tool to its fullest potential was born. The
        Pennsylvania Tree Selector Tool website is the result of years of
        development.

      <h3>What is the Chesapeake Conservancy?</h3>
      <p>
        Chesapeake Conservancy (CC) is a nonprofit organization with offices in
        Annapolis, Maryland and Selinsgrove, PA. We are a team of 45
        conservation professionals and geospatial analysts. We believe that the
        Chesapeake is a national treasure that should be accessible for everyone
        and a place where wildlife can thrive. We use technology to accelerate
        the pace and quality of conservation, and we help build parks, trails,
        and public access sites. With global calls to protect 30% of land by
        2030 as a climate and biodiversity solution, CC uses artificial
        intelligence and groundbreaking data to accelerate progress in
        conserving landscapes vital to the Bay's health and its cultural
        heritage while connecting people to the Chesapeake.
      </p>
      <p>
        CC has seven staff members with decades of experience in conservation,
        based in central Pennsylvania. This team has been implementing
        agricultural and riparian buffer management practices on parcels chosen
        based on high-resolution land use and land cover data, developed by our
        Conservation Innovation Center (CIC), that helps identify parcels with
        the largest reductions in nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment pollution.
        Chesapeake Conservancy serves in a convening role facilitating large
        federal grant programs for riparian restoration projects, providing
        in-stream monitoring and serving to build capacity among a large partner
        network.
