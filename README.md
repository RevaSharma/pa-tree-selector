  - `components` - holds React components, which are JavaScript files that describe UI logic and structure
  - `App.js` - first React component that gets rendered, root of the app
  - `App.css` - styles all elements and components inside `App.js`
- `public` - holds all static assets (resources used by the app that do not change during runtime)
